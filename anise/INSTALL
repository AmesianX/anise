Project ANISE
=============

To build anise, make sure you have the following stuffs.

* SDL (>= 1.2.0)
	Simple DirectMedia Library
	http://www.libsdl.org

* automake (>= 1.6)
* autoconf (>= 2.53)
	GNU Autotools
	http://www.gnu.org

Run the 'autogen.sh' script to generate 'configure' and other necessary files.

	./autogen.sh

If you have no problem with that, now you can build your own binary.

	./configure
	make install

Then you may have 'anise' binary in /usr/local/bin/.
If you don't want to install but just want to keep in the current directory, type 'make' not 'make install'.

If you want to cross-compile it for Zaurus SL-C7X0/860, you must have Qtopia development environment.
You may want to see README.Qtopia file in SDL source tree for that.

Once you have all set up, you need to build by somewhat tricky way because the name of the compiler binaries differ from the standard.
Also you should disable features not needed.

        NM=arm-linux-nm LD=arm-linux-ld CC=arm-linux-gcc CXX=arm-linux-g++ AR=arm-linux-ar ./configure --host=arm-unknown-linux-gnu
	make

If you prefer, you can strip your binary file.

	arm-linux-strip anise
