Project ANISE
=============

To build anise, make sure you have the following stuffs.

* SDL (>= 1.2.0)
	Simple DirectMedia Library
	http://www.libsdl.org

* automake (>= 1.6)
* autoconf (>= 2.53)
	GNU Autotools
	http://www.gnu.org

Run the 'autogen.sh' script to generate 'configure' and other necessary files.

	./autogen.sh

If you have no problem with that, now you can build your own binary.

	./configure
	make install

Then you may have 'anise' binary in /usr/local/bin/.
If you don't want to install but just want to keep in the current directory, type 'make' not 'make install'.
